# Networking and Internet
## Overview

Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices to share resources, data, and communicate effectively. Networks enable devices such as computers, servers, routers, and switches to interact and exchange information. Here's a basic overview of the topic:

**Key Types of Networks**
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network confined to a small area like an office, home, or building.
- WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans large geographical areas, such as the internet.
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network designed for a city or large campus.
- PAN (Personal Area Network): A network for personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for smartphones and laptops).

**Common Networking Devices**
- Router: Directs data packets between networks and manages traffic.
- Switch: Connects devices in a LAN and facilitates data exchange within it.
- Access Point: Enables wireless devices to connect to a network.
- Modem: Converts digital signals to analog for internet access.
- Firewall: Protects a network by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.

**Networking Protocols**
Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted over a network. Key examples:

- **TCP/IP:** Foundation of internet communication.

- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for accessing web pages.

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files.

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses.

- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP:** Used for sending and receiving emails.

# OSI Model
**The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model organizes networking into seven layers:**

**Physical:** Hardware transmission (cables, switches).

**Data Link:** MAC addresses, frames.

**Network:** IP addressing, routing.

**Transport**: Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP).

**Session:** Manages sessions between applications.

**Presentation:** Data formatting and encryption.

**Application:** Interfaces for end-users (e.g., browsers, email).

## Wireless Networking

**Wi-Fi:** Wireless connectivity within a network.

**Bluetooth:** Short-range wireless communication.

**Cellular Networks (4G/5G):** Mobile internet connectivity.

## Importance of Networking
- Enables resource sharing (files, printers).
- Facilitates communication (email, VoIP).
- Provides centralized data management.
- Supports cloud computing and remote work.
