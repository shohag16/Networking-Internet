## Overview

Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices to share resources, data, and communicate effectively. Networks enable devices such as computers, servers, routers, and switches to interact and exchange information. Here's a basic overview of the topic:

**Key Types of Networks**
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network confined to a small area like an office, home, or building.
- WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans large geographical areas, such as the internet.
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network designed for a city or large campus.
- PAN (Personal Area Network): A network for personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for smartphones and laptops).

**Common Networking Devices**
- Router: Directs data packets between networks and manages traffic.
- Switch: Connects devices in a LAN and facilitates data exchange within it.
- Access Point: Enables wireless devices to connect to a network.
- Modem: Converts digital signals to analog for internet access.
- Firewall: Protects a network by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.

**Networking Protocols**
Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted over a network. Key examples:

- **TCP/IP:** Foundation of internet communication.

- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for accessing web pages.

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files.

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses.

- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP:** Used for sending and receiving emails.

# OSI Model
**The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model organizes networking into seven layers:**

**Physical:** Hardware transmission (cables, switches).

**Data Link:** MAC addresses, frames.

**Network:** IP addressing, routing.

# 1. Network Topologies
Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices in a network. Key types include:

**Physical Topologies**

**Bus Topology:** All devices connect to a single central cable (the bus). Easy to set up but prone to failures if the main cable breaks.

**Star Topology:** Devices connect to a central hub/switch. Easy to troubleshoot but relies heavily on the central hub.

**Ring Topology:** Devices form a closed loop. Each device is connected to two others. Failure in one device can affect the entire network unless a dual-ring topology is used.

**Mesh Topology:** Devices are interconnected. High reliability but complex and expensive.

**Hybrid Topology:** Combines two or more types of topologies, e.g., star-bus or star-ring.

# 2. IP Addressing and Subnetting

## IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network.

**IPv4 Addressing**

**Format:** Four 8-bit octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

# Subnetting: A Complete Guide

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (**subnets**). It improves network efficiency, security, and organization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ IP Address Basics
An **IP address** consists of four octets (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), where each octet is an 8-bit number (0-255).

**Example:**
- **IP Address:** `192.168.1.1`
- **Binary Representation:** `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Classes of IP Addresses

| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask | Default Network Bits | Default Host Bits | No. of Hosts per Network |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **A** | `1.0.0.0 â€“ 126.255.255.255` | `255.0.0.0` | 8 | 24 | 16,777,214 |
| **B** | `128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.255.255` | `255.255.0.0` | 16 | 16 | 65,534 |
| **C** | `192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.255` | `255.255.255.0` | 24 | 8 | 254 |
| **D** | `224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255` | **Reserved for Multicasting** | - | - | - |
| **E** | `240.0.0.0 â€“ 255.255.255.255` | **Reserved for Experimental Use** | - | - | - |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Subnet Mask
A **subnet mask** determines which portion of an IP address belongs to the **network** and which part belongs to **hosts**.

**Example:**
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
- **Binary:** `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

### Common Subnet Masks:

| Subnet Mask | CIDR Notation | No. of Subnets | Hosts per Subnet |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| `255.0.0.0` | `/8` | 1 | 16,777,214 |
| `255.255.0.0` | `/16` | 256 | 65,534 |
| `255.255.255.0` | `/24` | 65,536 | 254 |
| `255.255.255.128` | `/25` | 131,072 | 126 |
| `255.255.255.192` | `/26` | 262,144 | 62 |

---

## ðŸ“Œ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR notation represents subnet masks using a **slash (/)** followed by the number of bits in the network portion.

**Examples:**
- `192.168.1.0/24` â†’ `255.255.255.0` (256 addresses, 254 usable)
- `192.168.1.0/26` â†’ `255.255.255.192` (64 addresses, 62 usable)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Subnetting Calculation

### **Formula to calculate subnets & hosts:**
1. **Number of Subnets:** `2^n` (where `n` = borrowed bits)
2. **Number of Hosts per Subnet:** `2^h - 2` (where `h` = host bits, subtracting 2 for network & broadcast)

#### Example:
- **Given:** `192.168.1.0/26`
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.192`
- **Network Bits:** `26`
- **Host Bits:** `6`
- **Number of Subnets:** `2^2 = 4`
- **Hosts per Subnet:** `2^6 - 2 = 62`

| Subnet | First Usable IP | Last Usable IP | Broadcast |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| `192.168.1.0/26` | `192.168.1.1` | `192.168.1.62` | `192.168.1.63` |
| `192.168.1.64/26` | `192.168.1.65` | `192.168.1.126` | `192.168.1.127` |
| `192.168.1.128/26` | `192.168.1.129` | `192.168.1.190` | `192.168.1.191` |
| `192.168.1.192/26` | `192.168.1.193` | `192.168.1.254` | `192.168.1.255` |

---

## ðŸ“Œ VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)
VLSM allows **different-sized subnets** in the same network, optimizing IP usage.

### Example:
- `/28` for small networks (**14 hosts**)
- `/26` for medium networks (**62 hosts**)
- `/24` for large networks (**254 hosts**)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Subnetting Example

**Requirement:** Divide `192.168.10.0/24` into four subnets.

1. **Subnet Mask:** `/26` (255.255.255.192)
2. **Each subnet has:** `62` usable hosts
3. **New subnet ranges:**

| Subnet | First Usable IP | Last Usable IP | Broadcast |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| `192.168.10.0/26` | `192.168.10.1` | `192.168.10.62` | `192.168.10.63` |
| `192.168.10.64/26` | `192.168.10.65` | `192.168.10.126` | `192.168.10.127` |
| `192.168.10.128/26` | `192.168.10.129` | `192.168.10.190` | `192.168.10.191` |
| `192.168.10.192/26` | `192.168.10.193` | `192.168.10.254` | `192.168.10.255` |
